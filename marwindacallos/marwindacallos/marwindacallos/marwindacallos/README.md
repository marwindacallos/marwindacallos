I've been stuck on tutorial hell for almost 6 months, I become comfortable on doing basic stuffs that makes me afraid to do some challenges.
Well now, I'm doing all my best to be the best version of me, for 6 months I learned that I can't live with only motivation, it will not permanently change me, I'm so eager to know who I am, and now I'm happy that I found my purpose in life.
      Most people are struggling to find their reason for living, and I'm happy that I found mine, I called it awakening, and this coding journey will support me to achieve great things in life. I want to contribute in future and help the next generation to make their lives easier and fun.
